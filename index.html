    <p>Right now, my focus is on building model-driven assessments for government and public-facing AI services, but I'm broadly interested in leveraging human data to build safer, more robust AI systems. I've worked previously on value-alignment in recommendation systems, LLM benchmarking, clinical AI, natural language processing, and technology policy. Feel free to read more under my my <a href = "/resume">resume</a> :)</p>
