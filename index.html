    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Sana! I'm a <a href="https://cdss.berkeley.edu/news/sana-pandey-uses-ai-shape-brighter-future-society">recent graduate of UC Berkeley</a> with degrees in data science and cognitive science. I also minored in Mandarin, and co-captained the UC Berkeley Fencing team. I work at <a href="https://hortus.ai/">Hortus AI</a>, and am affiliated with the <a href = "https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)</a> and the <a href = "https://humancompatible.ai/">Center for Human Compatible AI (CHAI)</a>. Right now, my focus is on building assessment frameworks for government and public-facing AI services, but I'm broadly interested in leveraging human data to build safer, more robust AI systems.  
      I've worked previously on value-alignment in recommendation systems, LLM benchmarking, clinical AI, natural language processing, and technology policy. Feel free to read more under my <a href = "/resume">resume</a> :).</p>
